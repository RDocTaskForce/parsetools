# Making Contributions

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the documentation project packages.
You may contribute by filing issues, commenting on issues or coding and making
pull requests.

All new code contributions must be made through pull requests.  If you would like 
to contribute code please make sure that all requests follow the 
[contributor code of conduct](CONDUCT.md).

This project is funded and owned by the R Consortium.  Pull requests, in order 
to be accepted must acknowledge a transfer of copyright to the R Consortium for 
accepted code.  Pull requests that do not include a statment acknowledging 
a transfer of copyright will be rejected as a matter of policy.  
An example statement is provided below. 

> I certify that I am the original author of the code included in this
> pull request, that I own the intelectual property rights (including copyright), 
> and that I am authorized to transfer said rights.  I acknowledge that if and 
> when the pull request is accepted included code and associated intelectual 
> rights (including copyright) become the sole property of the R Consortium.

The transfer of ownership of the copyright is to maintain simplicity in legal 
matters.  For example changing the open source license will not require that all 
copyright holders sign off.
